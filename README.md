# playing_with_sentiments
This is my first Machine learning based solo fun project
  There are many projects for sentiment analysis
Here I've tried to create a model(s), and test which one gives better results.


You gotta run the file, classifiers.py
And then hang out with check_sentiments.py
File should run like this:

      Enter the string: [Your Desired String]
      According to logistic Classifier: 
      According to KNN Classifier: 
      According to Random Forest Classifier: 
      According to Decision Tree Classifier: 

    You can also get your hands dirty and have a look at classifiers_testing.py


The results speak that Logistic regression(approximately 50%) is far more impressive than the rest(followed by Random Forest classification, Decision Tree Classification, K-Nearest Neighbours, and the rest of basic classifiers)

Lack of data has hampered the results(Uploaded)

Thank you
