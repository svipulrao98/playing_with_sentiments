# playing_with_sentiments
This is my first Machine learning based solo fun project
  There are many projects for sentiment analysis
Here I've tried to create a model(s), and test which one gives better results.


You gotta run the file, classifiers.py
And then hang out with check_sentiments.py

    You can also get your hands dirty and have a look at classifiers_testing.py


The results speak that Logistic regression is far more impressive than the rest(followed by Random Forest classification, Decision Tree Classification, K-Nearest Neighbours)

Lack of data has hampered the results(Uploaded)

Thank you
